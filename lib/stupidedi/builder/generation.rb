      # Consumes all input from `reader` and returns the updated
      # {StateMachine} along with the result of the last attempt
      # to read a segment.
      #
      # The `nondeterminism` argument specifies a limit on how many
      # parse trees can be built simultaneously due to ambiguity in
      # the input and/or specification. This prevents runaway memory
      # CPU consumption (see GH-129), and will return a {Result.failure}
      # once exceeded.
      #
      # The default value is 1, resulting in an error if any input
      # is ambiguous.
      #
      # NOTE: The error is detected *after* the resources are already
      # been consumed. The extra parse trees are returned (in memory)
      # via the {StateMachine} to aide diagnosis.
